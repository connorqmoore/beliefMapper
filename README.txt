Project motivation:

----------------------------------------------------
Big problem in how other people criticize and understand each others ideas.
People focus on the end claim and not on the roots of the argument.
It is easy to lose track of your own logical consistency when developing your own ideas.

Solution:

----------------------------------------------------
Generate a graph consisting of facts, and statements that illustrate an argument. 
Each statement and fact has some sort of confidence property.
Each sub-statement and fact has a relationship to its corresponding parent node at some relevance property.
Each fact has evidence supporting it.
A formula is used to calculate how well the root node is supported based off of its relationships.
Generate a graph consisting of facts, and statements that illustrate an argument.
